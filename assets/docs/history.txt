(Start with a powerful introductory paragraph)
The story of Jeevan Jyoti Foundation is not merely one of a date on a calendar, but of a profound commitment etched into a legal framework. Our history begins with a clear-eyed vision to address the most pressing needs of our community, a vision that was formalized and made irrevocable through the execution of a Trust Deed in the summer of 2023. This page documents our foundational journey, from the initial aspirations of our Settlor to the establishment of a robust, transparent institution dedicated to public service.

The Foundational Spark: The Settlor's Vision
The genesis of Jeevan Jyoti Foundation lies in the profound desire of Smt. Bhagya Laxmi Padhi. As the Settlor of the Trust, she envisioned a lasting, institutionalized force for good that would outlive individual efforts. Her vision was clear: to create a formal organization capable of undertaking wide-ranging charitable and research activities for the unequivocal benefit of the public.

Driven by this altruistic motive, Smt. Padhi took the first concrete step by settling a initial corpus fund of ₹10,000 (Rupees Ten Thousand) to seed the Foundation's activities, demonstrating a personal commitment to turning her vision into a tangible reality.

The Cornerstone: Execution of the Trust Deed
In June 2023, this vision was formally codified into law with the execution of the Jeevan Jyoti Foundation Trust Deed. This indenture serves as the Foundation's unshakeable constitutional document, laying down its objects, governance structure, and operational rules.

The founding was a collaborative effort, with Smt. Padhi being joined by the first Trustees who shared her commitment:

Smt. Bhagya Laxmi Padhi (Settlor & First Managing Trustee)

Sri. Akhaya Kumar Padhy

Sri. Purna Chandra Maharana

These individuals, as stated in the Deed, willingly accepted the office of Trustees, committing themselves to carrying out the wishes of the Settlor and upholding the solemn objects of the Trust.

The Founding Mandate: Objects of the Trust
From its very inception, the Foundation's scope was designed to be comprehensive. The Trust Deed meticulously outlined a wide-ranging mandate focused on four key pillars, which continue to guide all our initiatives:

Health & Sanitation: The Deed explicitly called for the promotion of holistic health, including establishing hospitals, medical research centers, mobile dispensaries, and ambulance services. A special focus was placed on eradicating diseases like Cancer, AIDS, TB, and Malaria, and promoting yoga, sanitation, and family welfare.

Education & Research: A commitment was made to support education in all its branches—from kindergarten to doctorate levels—and in diverse fields including arts, science, engineering, and skill development (like tailoring, computer education, and beautician courses). The mandate included providing scholarships and grants to deserving students.

Social Welfare & Upliftment of the Poor: The Foundation was charged with improving social welfare standards, aiding in disaster rehabilitation, supporting women and child welfare, and running institutions for the vulnerable, such as old-age homes and orphanages.

Agriculture & Housing: The Deed included objectives for agricultural development, water conservation, and providing aid for housing to the homeless, ensuring a focus on rural upliftment and sustainable living.

Establishing Governance: The First Board of Trustees
To ensure the Foundation's longevity and integrity, the Trust Deed established a clear governance structure. The first named Trustees automatically formed the initial Board of Trustees.

As per the Deed, Smt. Bhagya Laxmi Padhi was appointed as the First Managing Trustee for her lifetime, entrusting her with the leadership and responsibility to steer the Foundation according to its core principles. The Deed also laid out clear procedures for the appointment of future Trustees, roles for a Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer, and rules for conducting meetings, ensuring democratic and transparent management from day one.

The Irrevocable Promise
A defining characteristic of our history is the irrevocable nature of the Trust, as declared in its Deed. This means the assets and the very existence of Jeevan Jyoti Foundation are permanently dedicated to its charitable objects. The Deed firmly states that no part of the income or property shall ever be used for the benefit of the Settlor, Trustees, or their relatives. This legal provision embeds our commitment to public service into our DNA, ensuring that every resource is channeled solely towards fulfilling our mission.

Our Journey Forward
From this solid legal and philosophical foundation established in 2023, Jeevan Jyoti Foundation has embarked on its journey. Our history is the bedrock upon which we build our future. Every program we launch, every life we touch, is a continuation of the promise made on that day in June—a promise to serve, to empower, and to illuminate lives, now and for generations to come.

The principles and objects enshrined in our original Trust Deed continue to be the unwavering guide for all our actions and aspirations.
