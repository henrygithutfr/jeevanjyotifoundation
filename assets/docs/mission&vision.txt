Page Content: Our Mission & Vision
Introductory Paragraph:
Jeevan Jyoti Foundation was formally established on the bedrock of a profound and irrevocable Trust Deed, executed in June 2023. Founded by Settlor Smt. Bhagya Laxmi Padhi and a dedicated board of Trustees, our foundation is a registered Public Charitable Trust under the Indian Trusts Act. Every action we take and every goal we pursue is guided by the comprehensive objects and governing framework laid out in our founding document. This page elaborates on those core tenets that form the very soul of our organization.

Our Foundational Mission
Our mission is the practical execution of the "objects" defined in our Trust Deed. It is our daily commitment to the people of Odisha and India.

"To act as a pivotal force for holistic public utility, undertaking charitable activities and research for the benefit of the public without any distinction of caste, creed, religion, or sex. We are committed to pioneering efforts in healthcare, education, agricultural development, and social welfare, directly addressing the needs of the poor, the marginalized, and the underserved, as mandated by our founding principles."

This mission is broken down into our core operational pillars:

Health & Sanitation: To promote holistic health through the establishment of charitable hospitals, specialist medical centers, and mobile dispensaries. We focus on eradicating killer diseases like Cancer, AIDS, TB, and Malaria through awareness, prevention, and palliative care. Our mission includes promoting yoga, alternative medicine, and providing financial assistance to those who cannot afford medical treatment.

Education & Research: To support and promote educational advancement at all levels—from primary schools to doctorate programs—in diverse fields including Arts, Science, Commerce, Engineering, Medicine, and Skill Development (like tailoring, beautician courses, and computer education). A key focus is providing grants, scholarships, and books to needy and deserving students.

Social Welfare & Upliftment of the Poor: To work tirelessly for the improvement of social welfare standards. This includes rehabilitation for victims of natural calamities, support for women and child welfare, running orphanages and old-age homes, and directly feeding the poor through initiatives like Annadhanam.

Agriculture & Housing: To engage in rural agricultural development, including horticulture, medicinal plantations, and water conservation (digging wells, maintaining water reservoirs). We aim to improve the standard of living for farmers and provide aid for housing to the homeless.

Our Guiding Vision
Our vision is the long-term change we seek to create, inspired by the spirit of the Trust Deed.

"To forge a society where the light of life ('Jeevan Jyoti') burns brightly in every home—a society where no one is deprived of quality healthcare, transformative education, or dignified living conditions. We envision a self-reliant community, rooted in innovative research and sustainable practices, where the burdens of disease, poverty, and ignorance are replaced by the enduring pillars of health, knowledge, and opportunity."

Our Governing Principles & Values
The Trust Deed not only outlines what we do but also how we must operate. These are our non-negotiable values:

Irrevocable Commitment to Public Benefit: As per Clause XV, this Trust is irrevocable. Its assets and income are permanently dedicated to the public charitable objects defined at its inception. No part of the income or property shall ever be used for the benefit of the Settlor, Trustees, or their relatives.

Financial Integrity & Transparency: The Trust Deed mandates that the Treasurer prepare audited annual accounts by a Chartered Accountant. Our finances are managed with the utmost responsibility, and we operate with a service motive, not for profit.

Strategic Governance: The Foundation is managed by a Board of Trustees, led by the founding Managing Trustee, Smt. Bhagya Laxmi Padhi. The Deed clearly outlines the roles, responsibilities, and powers of the Managing Trustee, Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer to ensure effective and accountable administration.

Compliance with Law: We strictly adhere to the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961, and the Indian Trusts Act, 1882, ensuring all our activities are legally sound and beyond reproach.

The Legal Backbone: Our Trust Deed
The following core tenets from our Trust Deed are publicly stated here to affirm our transparency and legal standing:

Settlor & First Trustees: The Foundation was established by Smt. Bhagya Laxmi Padhi as the Settlor and First Managing Trustee, alongside Sri. Akhaya Kumar Padhy and Sri. Purna Chandra Maharana as the First Trustees.

Legal Status: A Trust registered under the Indian Charitable & Religious Trust Act, 1920.

Registered Office: At. Panda Colony 2nd Lane, Berhampur – 760010, Dist. Ganjam, Odisha, India.

Core Objective: The fundamental object is "establishing an organisation for undertaking charitable and research activities for the benefit of the public."

Dissolution Clause: In the event of dissolution, the remaining assets of the Trust shall be transferred to another Trust with similar objects, and shall under no circumstance be distributed to the Trustees.
